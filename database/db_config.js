Below, make a new table below called 'Users'.
Add 3 different collumns to the table: Name, Age, and Birthday
Remember: an id is automoatically generated when inserting a 
row. Don't forget to sync your table below and add it to module.exports

//all data from that particular table and starts it fresh
//You need to drop the table in order to make changes
